# Infact üì∞

An open-source implementation of a Ground News-like news aggregation service that desensationalizes public news through AI-powered clustering and fact extraction.

## Overview

Infact demonstrates an intelligent news processing pipeline that takes sensationalized articles and transforms them into factual, neutral reporting. The system clusters similar stories, extracts key facts, removes editorial bias, and generates clean, informative articles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Processing Pipeline
- **NLP Engine**: spaCy for text preprocessing and named entity recognition
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers (all-mpnet-base-v2) for semantic similarity
- **Clustering**: Scikit-learn KMeans with TF-IDF feature enhancement
- **Topic Modeling**: Gensim LDA for automatic cluster naming
- **Sentiment Analysis**: TextBlob for opinion detection
- **Similarity Matching**: FuzzyWuzzy for duplicate detection

### AI & Generation
- **LLM Integration**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for article generation
- **Orchestration**: LangChain for prompt management
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA support for faster embeddings

### Visualization & Interface
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for interactive demo
- **Charts**: Plotly for cluster visualization and analytics
- **Word Clouds**: Visual topic representation
- **Real-time Processing**: Live pipeline monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The pipeline processes news articles through six distinct stages:

1. **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization
2. **Clustering**: Semantic grouping of related articles
3. **Topic Extraction**: Automatic naming using LDA topic modeling
4. **Fact Extraction**: Separation of facts from opinions using NER and sentiment analysis
5. **Deduplication**: Merging similar facts to reduce redundancy
6. **Article Generation**: Creating neutral, factual articles using LLM

## üìä Efficiency & Scalability

### Performance Optimizations
- **Batch Processing**: Embeddings generated in configurable batches (default: 32)
- **Memory Management**: Text truncation for large articles (1M char limit)
- **GPU Acceleration**: Automatic CUDA detection and utilization
- **Caching**: Model loading cached to prevent reinitialization
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent operations run simultaneously

### Scalability Features
- **Modular Design**: Each pipeline stage is independently scalable
- **Configurable Clustering**: Dynamic cluster count based on article volume
- **Resource Limits**: Built-in safeguards for memory and processing time
- **Streaming Ready**: Architecture supports real-time article ingestion
