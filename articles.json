Lead service lines were commonly installed before 1986 when their use was banned, with an estimated 6-10 million still in service nationwide. Water treatment can reduce lead leaching through pH adjustment and corrosion control, but complete removal requires physical replacement of pipes. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure, which can cause developmental delays and learning difficulties even at low levels.",
        "background": "Federal and state programs provide funds, but smaller utilities face administrative burdens. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $15 billion specifically for lead service line replacement, with additional funding from state revolving loan programs. However, many small utilities lack the engineering staff and project management capacity to efficiently access and deploy these funds. Mapping existing lead lines remains a challenge since many utilities have incomplete records of pipe materials installed decades ago.",
